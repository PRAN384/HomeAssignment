Need a message structure

$NAVREQ,<1>,<2>,<3>;
<1>: Robot ID (1,MAX_NUM_BOTS)
<2>: Direction
<3>: System time at sending

==============================
$INITROB,<1>,<2>;
<1>: Robot ID
<2>: System time at sending

$NAVRES,{id:(i,j)}


==================


Grid Symantics

n X n 

n can be even or odd

in case even, we dont have a center Tile where robot can spawn

->Spawning/initialisation method for a robot on the simulation map, where to spawn? What are the assumptions?

->Need server heartbeat! so that the robots dont try 


Assumptions:

-> Robot name less than 10 Characters, will be saved in capitals



Todo:

-> Add exit simulation command and assign an input to it
-> Routine in case the server closes


-> Using -id as position about to be freed
